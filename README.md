# MulticlassClassification

Multiclass or multinominal classification is the problem og classifying items into one of three or more classes.

## Data preperation

One of the main challeges in machine learning is the preparation of the data, meaning the data needs to be formatted in such a way that it can be passed to a single neuron or nerual network. 

Generally in classification, we have data (image/text) and the class for that data. Though machine leaning we are trying to find some function that will correlate an unseen data to a specific class (by gving a probability distrubution) using the existing classified data.

Suppose
x -> data
y -> class of the data belongs to

we need make a neural network which give a probability distributon of classed by analyzing the data

P(y) = F(x) 
where P(y) is the probability distribution of the classes for data x
F - neural network.
